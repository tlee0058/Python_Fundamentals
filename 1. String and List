#Assignment: String and List Practice ##
Use only the built-in methods and functions from the previous tabs to do the following exercises. You will find the following methods and functions useful:

• .find()

• .replace()

• min()

• max()

• .sort()

• len()

Find and Replace
In this string: words = "It's thanksgiving day. It's my birthday,too!" print the position of the first instance of the word "day". Then create a new string where the word "day" is replaced with the word "month".

Min and Max
Print the min and max values in a list like this one: x = [2,54,-2,7,12,98]. Your code should work for any list.

First and Last
Print the first and last values in a list like this one: x = ["hello",2,54,-2,7,12,98,"world"]. Now create a new list containing only the first and last values in the original list. Your code should work for any list.

New List
Start with a list like this one: x = [19,2,54,-2,7,12,98,32,10,-3,6]. Sort your list first. Then, split your list in half. Push the list created from the first half to position 0 of the list created from the second half. The output should be: [[-3, -2, 2, 6, 7], 10, 12, 19, 32, 54, 98]. Stick with it, this one is tough!#

#find and replace
string = "If monkeys like bananas, then I must be a monkey!"
print string
print string.find("monkey")
string = string.replace("monkey", "alligator")
print string

#min and max
x = [2,54,-2,7,12,98]
print x
print min(x)
print max(x)

#first and last
x = ["hello",2,54,-2,7,12,98,"world"]
print x[0], x[len(x) - 1]

#new list
x = [19,2,54,-2,7,12,98,32,10,-3,6]
print x
x.sort()
print x
first_list = x[:len(x)/2] # optional first parameter of slice defaults to zero
second_list = x[len(x)/2:] # optional second parameter of slice defaults to the list's length
print "first list", first_list
print "second_list", second_list
second_list.insert(0,first_list)
print second_list
